# vue-todo application with SOLID principles

## Intro
```
In this simple application i tried to use SOLID principles. Ofcourse, maybe not all parts of application were done correctly, but i tried to do so. Mostly i payed attention to S,O and D principles. Because it is hard to to do 'L' and 'I' in simple javascript.

You can choose different api providers for this example in src/api-providers/index.js. localStorage is chosen by default.
